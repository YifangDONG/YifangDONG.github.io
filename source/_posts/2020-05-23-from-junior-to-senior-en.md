I'm a young developer. It's been three years since I started working. Over the last year, I've been asking myself what the difference is between the undergraduate, the junior, and the senior developer. In the latest one-to-one meeting with my manager, I kind of found the difference. The undergraduate developers learn new things. The juniors learn how to do things well. And the seniors focus on valuable things.

When I was at university, I had to take lots of courses, do projects, and pass exams. There's no denying that I studied hard, but in fact, I have no idea whether the projects I did were useful or not in reality. I don't understand the true meanings of "composition over inheritance" that I wrote about in my exams. It looks like if you get higher grades than your classmates, you have done a better job. But that's definitely not the case. Undergraduate education follows a rule of "the more the better". You get higher grades because you implement an extra function in your project. However, it's really a bad design which makes the app difficult to use. While your classmate uses a design pattern to make the project more scalable, but it's not what your professor is looking for. Because of the lack of feedback, I don't know what's good and what's bad, so I can't improve my skill. 

When I started to work for a company, the first lesson I learned was that there were no more one-shot projects. The code you add to the project may be modified after one month, one year or even ten years later. So your code must follow some standards and be of good quality. I have improved my code quality from the feedback of the code review. I have learned how to make a trade-off by discussing different solutions with my colleagues. As a junior, I try my best to deliver each feature assigned to me to a good standard, but I never think about why I need to implement this function, or what the value of it is.

At our last one-to-one meeting, my manager told me he is preparing a big feature for our team to work on for the next four months. He explained a bit about the context. In the end, he said that he needed to do some research on the feasibility and the cost to see if it's worth doing. I realized when I was working on each small feature, bug fix, or assigned task, that my manager was thinking about the evolution of the project, and which potential direction would add the most value.

It's not easy to assess the value of a feature, which may vary depending on experience, knowledge, and taste. I am gaining valuable experience in learning how to do this well. When I am assigned a feature, I can discuss it with the product manager. We can talk about the context and why the client needs it. So, I can understand the value of the feature. When organizing a workshop, I should ask the participants for feedback on which part is useful for them and have a discussion about any parts that are not. So next time I can focus more on the valuable parts. By focusing on delivering the most valuable product, I will have enough time to do things properly.
